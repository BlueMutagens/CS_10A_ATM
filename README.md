A decimal to binary converter and an interactive atm prompt

Binary_all is simply a decimal to binary cnoverter program that uses decreasing powers of 2

ATM is my first interactive while loop. It simulates an atm machine, allowing the user to deposit, withdraw, and check account balance.
The program continues to run until the user selects the quit option
